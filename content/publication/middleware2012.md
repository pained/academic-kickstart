# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "While previous CSCW research has noted that computer scientists have their own research interests pertaining to cyberinfrastructure development projects, most have focused on the research imperatives of scientists. This qualitative, interview-based study investigates the perspective of computer scientists developing middleware software for cyberinfrastructures at two supercomputing centers. This paper examines how technologists develop and sustain middleware applications over time by leveraging expertise and partnering with different research domains in order to achieve long-term infrastructural goals."
