# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This work explores the question: How can the idea of educational practice as a design endeavor be leveraged to better understand the implications for practice articulated in published research studies in engineering education? At a general level, our approach combines features of content analysis, rhetorical analysis, and hermeneutic analysis. We found that interpreting implications for practice sentences through a design perspective proved feasible and promising. Analysing implications for practice more comprehensively from a design perspective might help to synthesize across studies, and thus accelerate and achieve research that matters in helping to inform practice."
