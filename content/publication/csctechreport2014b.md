abstract = "Software is an important infrastructural component of scientific research practice. The work of research often requires scientists to develop, use, and share software in order to address their research questions. This report presents findings from a survey of researchers at the University of Washington in three broad areas: Oceanography, Biology, and Physics. This survey is part of the National Science Foundation funded study Scientists and their Software: A Sociotechnical Investigation of Scientific Software Development and Sharing (ACI-1302272). We inquired about each respondent’s research area and data use along with their use, development, and sharing of software. Finally, we asked about challenges researchers face with and about concerns regarding software’s effect on study replicability. These findings are part of ongoing efforts to develop deeper characterizations of the role of software in twenty-first century scientific research."
