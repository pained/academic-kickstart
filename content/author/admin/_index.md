***Work in progress!***

I am a qualitative researcher and trained software engineer. I study the collaborative work practices of stakeholders creating and using ecosystems/infrastructures of software and data. I have studied the big data work of climate scientists, oceanographers, microbiologists, and physicists/astronomers. My research supports the design of practices, products, and policies by using interviews, surveys, observations, and artifact analyses.

I received a Bachelor of Science in [Software Engineering](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/academic-departments/computer-science-software-engineering.aspx), with a minor in Economics, from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/) in 2010. I completed my PhD in the [Department of Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering](http://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) in Seattle, WA in August 2016. I have had the privilege of being advised by [Dr. Charlotte P. Lee](http://faculty.washington.edu/cplee/) in the [Computer Supported Collaboration Laboratory](http://depts.washington.edu/csclab/) where I was also the lab manager and a post-doctoral researcher. Since August 2017 I have been a Computer Science post-doctoral researcher in the [Usable Software Systems](http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/uss/) group in the [Data Science and Technology Department](http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/) at Lawrence Berkeley Lab working with [Lavanya Ramakrishnan](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/staff/lavanya-ramakrishnan/).
